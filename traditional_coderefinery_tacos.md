Traditional American Taco
This is the configuration that many American children are surprised to grow up and discover is not Mexican in the least.
Ground Beef
Hard Corn Shells
Cheese
Tomatoes
Lettuce
Hot Sauce/Salsa (store bought is fine; for fresh alternatives check out the Condiments list)
Optional
Guacamole (Simple)
Sour Cream
Black Olives
Cook the ground beef; heat the shells; chop the tomatoes; shred the cheese and lettuce. Stick a spoon in the salsa.
Once everything's on the table, anything goes. Tradition holds that the meat goes first and the cheese goes on the meat (so as to promote melting).
