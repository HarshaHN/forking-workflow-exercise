# Cauliflower tacos

This recipe is taken as an example from https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy/blob/master/full_tacos/cauliflower_tacos.md.

This is the original recipe as can be found in the original file 
cauliflower_tacos.md

- Roast cauliflower
- Pickled chilis and vegetables
- Caramelized red onions
- Guacamole
- Yogurt
- Tortilla of choice, warmed in a dry pan

//

addition:
- Red cabbage is an excellent addition to this palate
- I'd avoid yoghurt for the sake of lactose and vegans
- would recomend a tomato-based version or maby mashed roasted peppers
